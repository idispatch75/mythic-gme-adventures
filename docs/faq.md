### Will my language be supported in Meaning Tables?

The translations are provided by external contributors.

If you are willing to contribute a translation for a language,
or amend an existing one, you can find instructions [here](https://github.com/idispatch75/mythic-gme-adventures/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md).

### Will the application be translated into my language?

It is not planned.  
The wording is pretty basic and if the user managed to read the Mythic GME rules,
understanding the interface won't be a problem.

### Will the application support OneDrive / Dropbox?

The code is designed to support different online storages.

I did not investigate these 2 options, but if there is enough demand I may consider it.

### Will the application be available for iOS / macOS?

Apple requires developers to pay a license to publish applications for iOS / macOS.
It costs $99 **per year**.

I want to keep the App free and do not wish to pay this much.  
The [Web version](https://idispatch75.github.io/mythic-gme-adventures/user_manual/#web-app) should do for unsupported OS.

### The application is ugly. Do you plan to do something about it?

Unfortunately I'm not a designer.  
I did my best to make the application functional, but I am no artist.
